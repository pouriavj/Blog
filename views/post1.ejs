        An essay has to tell people something they don't already know. But there
        are three different reasons people might not know something, and they
        yield three very different kinds of essays.
      </p>
      <p>
        One reason people won't know something is if it's not important to know.
        That doesn't mean it will make a bad essay. For example, you might write
        a good essay about a particular model of car. Readers would learn
        something from it. It would add to their picture of the world. For a
        handful of readers it might even spur some kind of epiphany. But unless
        this is a very unusual car it's not critical for everyone to know about
        it. [1]
      </p>
      <p>
        If something isn't important to know, there's no answer to the question
        of why people don't know it. Not knowing random facts is the default.
        But if you're going to write about things that are important to know,
        you have to ask why your readers don't already know them. Is it because
        they're smart but inexperienced, or because they're obtuse?
      </p>
      <p>
        So the three reasons readers might not already know what you tell them
        are (a) that it's not important, (b) that they're obtuse, or (c) that
        they're inexperienced.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I did this breakdown was to get at the following fact, which
        might have seemed controversial if I'd led with it, but should be
        obvious now. If you're writing for smart people about important things,
        you're writing for the young.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or more precisely, that's where you'll have the most effect. Whatever
        you say should also be at least somewhat novel to you, however old you
        are. It's not an essay otherwise, because an essay is something you
        write to figure something out. But whatever you figure out will
        presumably be more of a surprise to younger readers than it is to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a continuum of surprise. At one extreme, something you read can
        change your whole way of thinking. The Selfish Gene did this to me. It
        was like suddenly seeing the other interpretation of an ambiguous image:
        you can treat genes rather than organisms as the protagonists, and
        evolution becomes easier to understand when you do. At the other
        extreme, writing merely puts into words something readers were already
        thinking â€” or thought they were.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impact of an essay is how much it changes readers' thinking
        multiplied by the importance of the topic. But it's hard to do well at
        both. It's hard to have big new ideas about important topics. So in
        practice there's a tradeoff: you can change readers' thinking a lot
        about moderately important things, or change it a little about very
        important ones. But with younger readers the tradeoff shifts. There's
        more room to change their thinking, so there's a bigger payoff for
        writing about important things.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tradeoff isn't a conscious one, at least not for me. It's more like
        a kind of gravitational field that writers work in. But every essayist
        works in it, whether they realize it or not. This seems obvious once you
        state it, but it took me a long time to understand. I knew I wanted to
        write for smart people about important topics. I noticed empirically
        that I seemed to be writing for the young. But it took me years to
        understand that the latter was an automatic consequence of the former.
        In fact I only really figured it out as I was writing this essay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I know it, should I change anything? I don't think so. In fact
        seeing the shape of the field that writers work in has reminded me that
        I'm not optimizing for returns in it. I'm not trying to surprise readers
        of any particular age; I'm trying to surprise myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way I usually decide what to write about is by following curiosity.
        I notice something new and dig into it. It would probably be a mistake
        to change that. But seeing the shape of the essay field has set me
        thinking. What would surprise young readers? Which important things do
        people tend to learn late? Interesting question. I should think about
        that.

      <p>
        [1] It's hard to write a really good essay about an unimportant topic,
        though, because a really good essayist will inevitably draw the topic
        into deeper waters. E. B. White could write an essay about how to boil
        potatoes that ended up being full of timeless wisdom. In which case, of
        course, it wouldn't really be about how to boil potatoes; that would
        just have been the starting point.
